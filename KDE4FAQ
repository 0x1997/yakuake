   Yakuake KDE 4 FAQ (Last update: March 18th, 2008)
  ===================================================

Q: The open/retract animation is very jerky. It was a lot smoother in the
   KDE 3 version on the same system. Why is that?

A: While the specific reasons have yet to be uncovered, this appears to be
   caused by a combination of the Qt 4 toolkit with the proprietary nVidia
   graphics drivers' XRender acceleration framework, especially when using
   a non-scalable bitmap font in the terminal profile. The animation is as
   smooth as it was in KDE 3 with other implementations of XRencer accele-
   ration, e.g. the EXA-based one found in the Intel drivers or even the
   software implementation found in the Xephyr nesting X server. Try using
   a scalable fixed-width font like DejaVu Sans Mono.

   Update March 18th, 2008: Experimental new options added to the nVidia
   drivers in the beta version 171.06 suggest that nVidia may be aware of
   and working to resolve this issue. See:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: There's a flicker in the animation when closing the window. What about
   that?

A: This is caused by a bug in the Fade Out window effect in the KDE window
   manager, kwin, related to how it handles window masks. A fix will be in-
   cluded in KDE 4.0.3 and higher. Alternatively, the effect can be dis-
   abled in System Settings.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I am using KWin Desktop Effects and have the "Shadows" option enabled,
   but the Yakuake window does not have a shadow. How come?

A: Support for shadows for shaped windows (aka windows with a "mask") is
   presently disabled in KWin due to bugs in the relevant code. It is ex-
   pected to be reintroduced in a later KDE release.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I have translucency enabled in my terminal profile, but the terminal
   does not appear translucent in practice. It works in Konsole with the
   "--enable-translucency" command line argument, but not in Yakuake.

A: The Konsole KPart component that Yakuake embeds does not have support
   for XComposite translucency in the KDE 4.0 release. I have contributed
   the required changes to Konsole, and they will be released with KDE
   4.0.1 and later versions. When using a sufficiently new version of the
   kdebase module the "--enable-translucency" command line is not required
   in Yakuake, and in fact not supported.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Translucent areas of my skin look rather different from how they used
   to look in the KDE 3 version. Why is that?

A: While the KDE 4 incarnation of Yakuake tries hard to preserve compati-
   bility with existing skins, the replacement of pseudo-translucency with
   XComposite translucency results in different blending behavior between
   skin elements and their background. Unfortunately this is outside the
   area of influence of the Yakuake code at this time. Translucent areas
   in skins may have to be adjusted accordingly.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: The terminal display corrupts in odd ways when I scroll. Anything I can
   do?

A: This is often caused by using compositing with an older version of the
   nVidia proprietary graphics driver, which has a known rendering bug with
   Qt 4 scrollviews on an ARGB visual. nVidia fixed the problem in version
   169.07 of the driver.

   Terminal display corruption may also occur when using compositing and Qt
   4.4 Beta 1. It is presently unclear if this problem will persist until
   the final release of Qt 4.4. In the meantime, a workaround for this pro-
   blem was added to the development version of the KDE 4 kdebase module on
   March 10th, 2008. Depending on how the situation develops, this work-
   around may be included with KDE 4.1 and possibly backported to a 4.0.x
   release.

Q: I am using KWin Desktop Effects and have the "Shadows" option enabled,
   but the Yakuake window does not have a shadow. How come?

A: Support for shadows for shaped windows (aka windows with a "mask") is
   presently disabled in KWin due to bugs in the relevant code. It is ex-
   pected to be reintroduced in a later KDE release.

Q: The open/retract animation is very jerky. It was a lot smoother in the
   KDE 3 version on the same system. Why is that?

A: While the specific reasons have yet to be uncovered, this appears to be 
   caused by a combination of the Qt 4 toolkit with the proprietary nVidia
   graphics drivers' XRender acceleration framework, especially when using 
   a non-scalable bitmap font in the terminal profile. The animation is as
   smooth as it was in KDE 3 with other implementations of XRencer accele-
   ration, e.g. the EXA-based one found in the Intel drivers or even the
   software implementation found in the Xephyr nesting X server. Try using
   a scalable fixed-width font like DejaVu Sans Mono.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: There's a flicker in the animation when closing the window. What about
   that?

A: This is caused by the Fade Out window effect in the KDE window manager,
   kwin. Apparently it's using a too old snapshot of the window to fade
   out after Yakuake hides itself, which creates the appearance of the 
   window popping back briefly before disappearing. The issue is under in-
   vestigation. In the meantime, you might want to disable the Fade Out
   effect in System Settings.

Q: I have translucency enabled in my terminal profile, but the terminal
   does not appear translucent in practice. It works in Konsole with the 
   "--enable-translucency" command line argument, but not in Yakuake. 

A: The Konsole KPart component that Yakuake embeds does not have support
   for XComposite translucency in the KDE 4.0 release. I have contributed 
   the required changes to Konsole, and they will be released with KDE 
   4.0.1 and later versions. When using a sufficiently new version of the 
   kdebase module the "--enable-translucency" command line is not required 
   in Yakuake, and in fact not supported.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Translucent areas of my skin look rather different from how they used 
   to look in the KDE 3 version. Why is that?

A: While the KDE 4 incarnation of Yakuake tries hard to preserve compati-
   bility with existing skins, the replacement of pseudo-translucency with
   XComposite translucency results in different blending behavior between
   skin elements and their background. Unfortunately this is outside the
   area of influence of the Yakuake code at this time. Translucent areas
   in skins may have to be adjusted accordingly.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: The terminal display corrupts in odd ways when I scroll. Anything I can
   do?

A: This is usually caused by using compositing with an older version of the 
   nVidia proprietary graphics driver, which has a known rendering bug with 
   Qt4 scrollviews on an ARGB visual. nVidia fixed the problem in version 
   169.07 of the driver.
